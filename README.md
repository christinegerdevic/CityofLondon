# CityofLondon

### Final Exam work

The Home page (index.html) can be accessed on any page from the "Home" link at the bottom of the webpage.  Set up and design of the webpages were done on a small monitor (will therefore look different on a widescreen monitor).

CSS Concepts used:
1. Horizontal Menu with drop down submenus (About London & Online Services) navigating to other three pages from the 'About London' link is displayed on all four pages (lines 43 to 182)
2. Transform & Transition
